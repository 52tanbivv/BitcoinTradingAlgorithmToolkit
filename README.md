BitcoinTradingAlgorithmToolkit
==============================

A framework for logging, simulating, and analyzing prices of crypto currencies on various exchanges using technical analysis, fuzzy logic, and neural networks.

## Details

This was mostly an ambitious experiment. I wanted to see how well a neural network could learn the "rules" of the various Bitcoin markets' price movements. To do that I needed a framework for logging and then replaying price movements. Then I started to implement automated-trading techniques used on the NYSE on BTC-e and Mt. Gox like fuzzy logic and neural networks, based on a whole bunch of different technical indicators. I dug up some of them most common and more obscure indicators referenced in some classic NN-trading literature from old books, mathematical formulas, and other languages' implementations.
